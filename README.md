# Matsdj's Shattered Pixel Dungeon

A Roguelike RPG, with randomly generated levels, items, enemies, and traps! Based on the [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon).

This is just my own version of shattered pixel dungeon where I make changes I feel like.

# Finished changes:
Nothing

# Future Changes:

Ring of accuracy is very uninterresting to level up with scrolls so it could get crit at higher levels or increase vision range. Crit could cause interresting effects like crippel, stun, bleed.

Ring of Elements is also very uninteresting in my opinion because avoiding damage outright is ussually better and not to hard to do and the few time I do get hit I have enough health potions. Changing it to a magic shield that slowly charges back up would be more interresting in my opinion.

Ring of evasion is also not something I ever use. I could become more interresting if you can avoid traps aswell (higher level would avoid stronger traps), avoid the first attack from an enemy every once in a wile to improve consitency and allow for strategy(the cooldown would be lower at higher levels).

Ring of Force is also uninterresting in my opinion it's not a terrible ring but its also not very different from just having a weapon. Not sure what to do with this one

Ring of Might is also uninterresting but mostly because there aren't many things that need more strength or scale very well with strength since you already have strength potions. I think this ring needs an item that requeres a lot of strength to be interresting. Maybe there are rocks lying around that are to heavy to use normally but with the ring you could throw them around. These rocks would also block movement from enemies allowing some control over the enviroment. I was also thinking of a weapon that also becomes heavier with upgrades and does increasingly larger area damage and has a chance to paralize them aswel.

Ring of Tenacity has a similar problem to ring of elements. A shield that only blocks physical damage that slowly charges up to a max amount would be more easier to strategise around.

Alchemist toolkit would be more interresting if it added new drops from enemies and grass that could be crafted into items. It also would be more usable if consumable items where more consisten/less conditional.

Chalice of blood is not very interresting but very strong not sure how to fix it though.

Ethereal chains should criple enemies.

Horn of plenty should apply well fed when you exceed full hunger.

Master Thieves Armband makes them weakend and vulnerable instead of cripple to differentiate from Ethereal chains.

Talisman of Foresight is kinda weak because it offers no combat utility. It would be more usefull if it provided/improved mind vision like the tier 2 skill from the Huntress. Maybe extra information about enemies: How long until the eyeball shoots, Enemy viewing distance and if it sees you yet, etc. Also if the scry hits an enemy you will dodge their next attack.

Timekeeper's Hourglass should have the ability to revert the user to a state a few turns earlier like health and maybe position.

Unstable Spellbook should get a third option which allows you to delay the casting of the scroll at the cost of a charge.

Stewed Meat needs a reason to exist.
